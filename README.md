# FUTURE READY TALENT VIRTUAL INTERSHIP PROJECT
# PROJECT NAME - Covid 19 Predictor
# Made By - Priyansh Sharma

* Azure Web App Link - https://covid19predictor.azurewebsites.net

* This repository consists of files required to deploy a Web App created with Flask on Microsoft Azure. The project helps the user to identify whether someone is showing positive or negative covid symptoms by simply inputting certain values like oxygen level, breath rate, age, vaccination done or not etc. with the help of a Kaggle database.


# Resources used:
               * Azure Web App
               * Azure Resources
               * Visual studio code
               * Azure Machine Learning ( Random Forest Classifier Model )
               * other resources:- linux os which runs azure web app

* Project problem area - The whole World is fighting against the pandemic "THE CORONA VIRUS" . There has to be a way to predict if someone is having Covid 19 positive Symptoms and start treating it at the earliest. With the increasing demand for doctors, we need something that will help our Healthcare Industry to handle this critical situation comfortably.
* Project outcomes - I created a Web App "Covid 19 Predictor" where anyone on entering the present symptoms the patient shows can predict whether the patient is showing Covid 19 Positive symptoms or not and start treatment accordingly .
* Description - My Solution is a web application that takes in certain input for symptoms the patient is showing and tells the user if the patient is showing Covid 19 Positive Symptoms or Negative Symptoms in the future. This will solve the problem of patients finding out too late that they have Covid which will reduce Death count and less spread of Corona virus which leads to lesser cases in future . My app, uses machine learning model ( Random Forest Classifier Model ) to predict if a user will have Positive covid symptoms or not . This machine learning model is made with the help of a covid dataset. The app also shows the Model accuracy of the prediction it has made.
